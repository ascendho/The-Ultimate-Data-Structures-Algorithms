## Source code

I am currently following this course, constantly maintain this repo, besides the Java source code in the course, I am also trying to implement every data structure and algorithm in c++.



## Folder clarification

Each folder consists of four parts: **Java** for original java code, **cpp** for c plus plus-implemented code, one **README** for notes and one **Exercises** pdf.
