## Source code

I am currently working on this course, constantly maintain this repo, besides the Java source code in the course, I am also trying to implement every data structure and algorithm in c++, please feel free to **pull request** and submit a **issue**.



## Folder clarification

The folder names should generally be self-explanatory and consists of four parts: **Java** for original java code, **cpp** for c plus plus-implemented code, one **README** for notes(Extracted from the course) and one **Exercises** pdf.
